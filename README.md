# 🚀 LeetCode & Codility Mastery Curriculum

**Prep Smarter. Code Harder. Ace Interviews.**

Welcome to the ultimate 8-week grind where you’ll solve 100+ problems, optimize your brain (and code), and crush those technical interviews like a boss 💥

---

### 🧠 Goals
- Master core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Build speed and confidence under timed conditions 🕐
- Solve 100+ LeetCode/Codility problems (Easy ✅ Medium ✅ Hard 💀✅)
- Learn how to write clean, optimized code that interviewers love ❤️

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Know your way around a loop and a function (Python, Java, or C++)
- Familiar with arrays, basic syntax, and ready to level up 🔥

### 🛠 Tools You’ll Use
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) (Free account is good enough!)
- [Codility](https://codility.com) (Free lessons rock)
- Your favorite IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, Replit, etc.)
- Optional: [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) for guided videos, **Cracking the Coding Interview** book

---

### 🗓️ Weekly Flow
**Commitment**: 10–15 hrs/week (2–3 hrs a day, 5–6 days/week)

- 🧩 1-1.5 hr: Solve 1–2 problems daily (Mix it up: Easy, Medium, sneak in Hard)
- 🔍 0.5–1 hr: Review, refactor, and learn from solutions (Read top LeetCode discussions or NeetCode vids)
- 🔁 Weekly Review: Go back to 1–2 tricky problems from the week, rework them like a champ

### 🧪 Mock Tests
- End of Week 4 & 8: Simulate real LeetCode/Codility test environments — no peeking, timer on ⏱️

### 📊 Track Your Grind
Create a Google Sheet (or Notion, or your fave tracker)
- Columns: Problem name, Topic, Difficulty, Time Taken, Mistakes
- Target Ratio: 60% Easy / 30% Medium / 10% Hard
