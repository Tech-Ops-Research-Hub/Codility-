Optimization:
Always aim for O(n log n) or better time complexity unless specified.
Test edge cases (empty inputs, large numbers, negative values).


# Resources:
NeetCode.io: Follow their 150-list roadmap for structured practice.
LeetCode Discussions: Read top solutions for alternative approaches.
Codility Lessons: Complete all free lessons for test familiarity.
Cracking the Coding Interview: Read chapters on arrays, trees, and DP.


# Mock Interviews:
Use Pramp or Interviewing.io for peer practice.
Simulate Codility’s 1-2 hour test format (1-3 problems, strict scoring).


# Tracking Progress:
Maintain a log: Problem name, topic, difficulty, time taken, mistakes.
Review weekly to identify patterns (e.g., struggling with DP or graphs).




# Post-Curriculum Plan

Next Steps:
Continue solving 1-2 problems daily to maintain skills.
Focus on company-specific problems (e.g., Amazon’s LeetCode tagged questions).
Take additional Codility practice tests to improve performance scores.


Advanced Practice:
Tackle LeetCode Hard problems in weak areas.
Explore competitive programming platforms (e.g., Codeforces, AtCoder).


Interview Prep:
Practice explaining solutions aloud (clarity is key in interviews).
Review system design basics if applying for senior roles.
